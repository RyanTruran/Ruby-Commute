Ruby-Commute is a CLI application used to calculate the distance between 2 points Monday through Friday in the morning
and at night. I originally built this application when house hunting as i did not want to be surprised by unusual 
traffic patterns. (ie. quick commute on monday but long commute on some other day).

Application is completely configurable for changing the origin and destination. as well as the time that the api is using.
