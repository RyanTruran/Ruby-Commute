Ruby-Commute is a CLI application used to calculate the distance between 2 points Monday through Friday in the morning
and at night. I originally built this application when house hunting as i did not want to be surprised by unusual 
traffic patterns. (ie. quick commute on monday but long commute on some other day).

To get started, Add your Google Maps API Key. 
Change the default origin and destination as desired. 

You can adjust the traffic model by changing it as described in the API Instructions.

Application is completely configurable for changing the origin and destination. as well as the time that the api is using.
